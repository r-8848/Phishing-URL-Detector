### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- pip (Python package installer)
- Git

### How It Works

1. **News Aggregation**: News articles are fetched from various reputable sources using APIs.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Each article is analyzed using natural language processing (NLP) techniques to determine its sentiment.
3. **Categorization**: Articles are then categorized based on their sentiment:
   - **Positive**: Articles with a positive sentiment score.
   - **Negative**: Articles with a negative sentiment score.
   - **Neutral**: Articles with a neutral sentiment score.

### Sentiment Visualization

The sentiment analysis results are visualized using charts, providing a clear and immediate understanding of the sentiment distribution across the fetched news articles.
